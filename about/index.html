  My Professional Identity
  
    
    Link to heading
  

I am a software industry veteran who helps build, transform, and scale engineering organizations to create impactful and valuable software. To achieve that, I can draw upon almost three decades of experience in a wide array of related roles:

As a software engineer, I have built and delivered enterprise-grade software systems with a strong focus on agile principles and software craftsmanship.
As a software architect, I have used methods like ATAM to design and validate software architecture approaches for large scale software systems.
As a solution architect, I have laid the foundation for successful software projects by bridging the gap between business needs and software delivery.
As an agile coach and trainer, I have helped teams discover better ways of developing software.
As a product owner, product manager and product management coach, I have enabled organizations to generate value with software by better understanding the problems they wanted to solve.
As manager, I have shaped and grown software delivery organizations so that they provide the best possible service to their business while being great and inclusive places to work.
As a public speaker, author, and trainer, I have shared my experiences and skils with a wide range of audiences.

I&rsquo;ve worked with established businesses of all shapes and sizes, and with startups from seed to post-acquisition stage. While my domain experience is deepest in the software as as service space, I have successfully delivered projects and products in the insurance, retail, logistics, and manifacturing verticals.">
