<p>I am a passionate software developer with more than a decade of experience in designing and implementing software solutions for small and large businesses. 
I currently work for <a href="http://www.opitz-consulting.com">OPITZ CONSULTING</a>, where I act as coach and software architect with a focus on Java EE based solutions and test automation.</p>
<p>Favouring lightweight processes and tools, I have a long history working with and teaching the <a href="http://www.springframework.org">Spring Framework, including <a href="/publications">writing for the 
german Java Magazin and co-authoring two practice-oriented books</a>.</p>
<p>While coming from a mainly technical background, I have always held a strong belief in the principles of the Agile Manifesto. Acting as internal coach over the course of the last three years 
gave me the chance to focus more on the &quot;soft&quot; aspects of our profession. Today I am happy to be able to spend a significant amount of my time coaching teams on their way to 
agile and lean software development while promoting the ideas of software craftsmanship.</p>
