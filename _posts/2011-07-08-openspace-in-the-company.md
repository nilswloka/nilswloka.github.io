At the [consulting company I work
for](http://www.opitz-consulting.com), we have quite a few regular
meetings to exchange ideas between collegues who otherwise spend most
of their time at our customers' places.
Recently, we started employing [Open Space
Technology](http://www.openspaceworld.org/) at a few of them and
received great feedback, so I'd like to share the story with you.

## Expert forums
To facilitate knowledge transfer and communication between technical
experts across our branches, we have an institution called expert
forum. Every other month, every branch office sends one or more of
their experts in a given field to discuss current topics and to
identify need for action.
With some ten colleagues attending that meeting, you wouldn't consider
it a natural candidate for the Open Space format. Due to particular
constraints, we tried it nevertheless and so far found the results
encouraging. Here's the way we organize our expert forums:

With only a few participants and a single day of discussions, we felt
the need to allow for some preparation in advance, so we basically
moved the opening to our company wiki. Sessions are usually posted
well in advance of the actual meeting to facilitate identification of
additional participants.

Being preceded by status and project reports, the actual Open Space
usually takes the second half of the day, with two or three sessions
happening simultaneously.

As the expert forums have the goal of identifying need for action, a
common outcome of the sessions is the plan for an experiment or very
small internal project. The meeting is attended by at least one
decision maker with budget authority. During the Open Space's closing,
actions and project sketches will be presented by the sessions'
hosts. Because we aim for
[S.M.A.R.T. goals](http://www.goal-setting-guide.com/goal-setting-tutorials/smart-goal-setting),
budget can usually be allocated directly.

This has led to some interesting initiatives, ranging from the design
and implementation of retrospective facilitator trainings (which I
have blogged about [here](/2011/07/30/designing-a-facilitator-training-part-1.html "Designing a Facilitator training - Part 1")) to the founding of an application lifecycle
manangement task force.

I like to think about this form of Open Space as a market place of
ideas, so if you are confronted with a similar situation, you might
want to give the format a try.

## Division meeting
When using the Open Space Technology at our latest division meeting,
the goal was entirely different. With some forty consultants attending
a meeting scheduled for the evening hours, we wanted to try something
beyond your typical mind-numbing Powerpoint orgy. While we already had
some success with unusual presentation formats like
[Pecha-Kucha](http://www.pecha-kucha.org/), we always felt that the
most interesting discussions occurred at the dinner following the
actual meeting.

Thus we decided to merge dinner with meeting and have an Open Space
and sandwiches at the same time. As we weren't quite sure which level
of participation to expect with this being the first Open Space for
many of the colleagues, we prepared some sessions beforehand.

We ended up with three simultaneous sessions, lots of energy and great
feedback and will certainly stick with the Open Space format for our
division meetings.

Apart from the vivid discussions, it significantly lowers the
threshold for active participation and added a lot of diversity to a
meeting that threatened to become stale.

## Summary
These are only two examples of how to use Open Space Technology inside
a company. We found that it works exceptionally well even with a small
number of participants and we will surely explore other areas of
application. If you have held Open Space style meetings in a corporate
context, I'd love hearing your stories, so feel free to comment down
below.
