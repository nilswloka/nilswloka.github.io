In the [last post](/2011/07/30/designing-a-facilitator-training-part-1.html "Designing a Facilitator training - Part 1") of this series, I gave you an overview of the design principles and an outline of the actual workshop. In this part, I'd like to give a detailed description of the exercises I used during the workshop. Hopefully, you will find them useful for your own trainings.
