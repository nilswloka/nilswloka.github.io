title: Things Spring can&#39;t help with...

As you will most probably have noticed, I haven't written all that much
recently - nothing at all, actually. This is mainly due to the fact
that I have been exceptionally busy with things entirely out of
Spring's scope (yes, they exist). Please give a warm welcome to my
son, Leo Wloka, who has been born on the 21st of October. As you can
imagine, he and his mom will keep me rather busy for a while.

Nevertheless, I will, as I play around with the recent Spring 2.5
Release Candidate, blog about all noteworthy experiences. In the
meantime, my german readers might enjoy reading the 
[Spring Praxishandbuch](http://www.amazon.de/gp/product/3939084395?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=springify-21&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1638&amp;creative=6742&amp;creativeASIN=3939084395), which I had the pleasure of writing the
JMS chapter for.
