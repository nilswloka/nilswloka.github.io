This is your host Nils Wloka. Let me welcome you to my humble little
Spring blog, which, after months of hesitance - and struggle against
various pieces of blog software - I am happy to roll out today. Time
permitting, I will periodically entertain you with posts about my
various ideas and experiences regarding JEE development with the
Spring Framework.

Until then, I would like to point any German readers to the articles I
have written for the Advanced Spring series published in the German
[Java Magazin](http://javamagazin.de). 
Feel free to leave your comments and questions here.
