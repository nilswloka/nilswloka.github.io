It's been some time since I last wrote an article here, but after
having found [this](http://www.infoq.com/news/2008/04/springsource-app-platform)] in my [InfoQ](http://www.infoq.com/) feed today, I felt the
urge to share and discuss my thoughts.

Let me summarize the article for those of you who haven't yet had the
opportunity to read it. To put it in a nutshell, [SpringSource](http://www.springsource.com/) is about to or
already released as beta their own Java application container based on
Spring, Tomcat and OSGi. I'm not actually surprised by this move as
there have been a lot of hints pointing into this direction in the
past, the [acquisition of Covalent](http://www.springsource.com/web/guest/2008/covalentaquisition) probably being the most prominent one.

Anyway, I personally find it exciting news as, if the bundle delivers
what is promised in the article, this might mean that there will be a
"natural" application container choice for Spring-based
projects. Having seen a lot of high-profile app-server installations
in the field that were used as mere servlet containers (but with a
hefty administration and footprint overhead), I consider this a good
thing. Add the SpringSource support offer and you will have a much
easier time arguing in favour of Tomcat as a lightweight alternative.
Vice versa, it might be easier to argue in favour of the Spring
programming model once you can toss in a fully supported and
integrated runtime environment for it too.

I hope I can get my hands on a beta release soon to play around with
the OSGi deployment model (and to see whether I can bully Maven into
building PAR archives for me). In the meantime I'd really like to hear
what you think about the announcement.
