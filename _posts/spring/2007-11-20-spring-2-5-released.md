title: Spring 2.5 released

It's finally there, and with quite a handful of impressive new
features, too. I especially like the new configuration options and the
way you can actually do something vaguely similar to rapid prototyping
even in the Java Enterprise world now. In my humble opinion,
annotation-based controllers go a *long* way towards establishing
Spring MVC as a viable web framework alternative. Being a huge fan of
[Stripes'](http://www.stripesframework.org/)
"configuration-less" approach, I see some convergence here.

I also appreciate the efford that has gone into obtaining WebSphere
certification for Spring 2.5, as lack of server vendor support can -
at least with the clients I usually work for - still be an exclusion
criterion.

So, to put it in a nutshell: Congratulations on this release to
everybody at SpringSource and thanks for the awesome job you're doing
there.
